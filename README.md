# AngulIt

This repository contains the main project, `AngulIt`, which serves as a foundational Angular application. It also includes a sub-project, `capchat`, located in the `capchat/` directory, which is a CAPTCHA-like challenge system.

## Main Project: AngulIt

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.3.

### Development server

To start a local development server for `AngulIt`, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

### Building

To build the `AngulIt` project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

### Running unit tests

To execute unit tests for `AngulIt` with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

### Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing of `AngulIt`, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
